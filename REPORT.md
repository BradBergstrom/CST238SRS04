Notes: If you go into options, there is a secret mode

----

Tester Name: John (first timer)

Silent Test Notes:
	"Am I trying to make a connection between the two O's?"
	Player was initially confused as to which way he was supposed to make it across.
	
Interview Notes:
	Q: Where there any things that surprised you?
	R: nope
	
	Q: Was there anything you expected to be able to do that you couldn't?
	R: I thought I would be able to choose who was X or O. Other than that, no.
	
	Q: try to go to the options, did everything make sense?
	R: yeah it did, although the arrow to go back to the menu should have been facing the other way. Kind of disorienting. 
Issues:
	-Change arrow in option menu
	-allow user to pick peice (and maybe color)
	-implement How to Win 
	-fix game logic so that a player can actually win

Fix:

Tester Name: Jordan (first timer)

Silent Test Notes:
	user tried double clicking when the player 2 pop up froze, that almost took player 1s turn
	user was able to play the game after a few seconds, and after watching John take his first move.
	both users caught on pretty quickly and were not confused about anything until the game was over.

Interview Notes:
	Q: Where there any things that surprised you?
	R: no
	
	Q: Where there anything you expected to be able to do that you couldn't?
	R: no, it seems pretty self explanitory. Is there a reset button?
	
	Q: try to go to the options, did everything make sense?
	R: (chuckles) yeah thats cool. maybe have the options arrow point backwards. 
	
Issues:

Fix:
	-Change arrow in option menu
