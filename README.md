Connect

Create a game called Connect.

The Connect game is a two player game. One player is black, the other white. The black player goes first and alternates turns with the white player. 

The board starts with alternating white/black/grey squares. A picture of a sample starting board is provided in Connect.png. 

Players may only play in unplayed grey squares that are in between their own color squares connecting them. Once a square is either black or white, it can not be changed for the remainder of the game. 

The winner is the first player to either make a connecting loop or to connect opposite ends of the board. 

Once your game is written, save a copy of your game as an alpha program.

Once completed, there will be a second phase of the project that will involve UX testing.
